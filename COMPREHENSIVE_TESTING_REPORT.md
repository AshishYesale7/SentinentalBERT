- **Files Modified**:
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Removed all `:-fallback` patterns
  - `.env` - Added secure passwords for all services
  - `INSIDEOUT_SECURE_SKELETON/auth/secure_authentication.py` - Environment variable usage

#### 2. Docker Security Hardening
- **Issue**: Insecure Docker configurations
- **Fix**: Added security options and removed default passwords
- **Improvements**:
  - `no-new-privileges: true` for privilege escalation prevention
  - `read_only: true` for filesystem protection
  - Environment variable enforcement
  - Removed all hardcoded fallback passwords

#### 3. Authentication System Implementation
- **Issue**: Missing JWT authentication and RBAC
- **Fix**: Complete authentication system with JWT tokens and role-based permissions
- **Features**:
  - JWT token creation and verification
  - Role-based access control (Admin, Investigator, Analyst, Viewer)
  - Token expiration handling
  - Tampering detection
  - Session management

#### 4. Legal Compliance Framework
- **Issue**: Missing warrant verification and chain of custody
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive legal framework
- **Components**:
  - Warrant verification system with digital signatures
