---

## üîç INVISIBLE HALLUCINATIONS DETECTED

### Mock Implementations
```python
# services/evidence/main.py:167
"""Validate warrant with court system (mock implementation)"""
# In production, this would connect to court database
# For now, we'll do basic validation

# services/evidence/main.py:106
# Blockchain service (mock for now)
self.blockchain_endpoint = os.getenv('BLOCKCHAIN_ENDPOINT', 'http://blockchain:8545')
```

### Placeholder Code
```python
# Multiple files contain hardcoded test data
# Dummy implementations for critical security features
# Non-functional legal authority verification
```

### Logic Inconsistencies
```
1. Claims to require "valid legal authority" but has no verification
2. Evidence handling marked as "encrypted" but uses weak algorithms
3. Chain of custody tracking incomplete and non-compliant
```

- **No Legal Authority Verification** system in place
- **Mock Implementations** of critical security features
- **Constitutional Violations** in design and operation
- **Evidence Inadmissibility** due to weak chain of custody
- **Privacy Violations** with no data protection controls

### Final Recommendation:
**COMPLETE REDESIGN REQUIRED** - The platform cannot be safely deployed in its current state and requires 12-18 months of development to reach production readiness.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Security Risk**: CRITICAL
- **Legal Risk**: CRITICAL  
- **Operational Risk**: HIGH
- **Reputational Risk**: HIGH

**This platform should not be deployed until all critical issues are resolved and proper legal compliance is achieved.**
