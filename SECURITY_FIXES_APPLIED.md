# Security Fixes Applied to SentinentalBERT

## Overview
This document details all security vulnerabilities that have been identified and fixed in the SentinentalBERT project. The fixes address critical security flaws that could have led to data breaches, unauthorized access, and legal compliance violations.

## üîí Critical Security Fixes Applied

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials Removed
**Files Fixed:**
- `services/evidence/main.py` (lines 96-108)
- `services/viral_detection/main.py` (lines 70-91)
- `docker-compose.yml` (multiple services)

**Changes Made:**
- Removed hardcoded database passwords (`sentinel123`, `redis123`)
- Added environment variable usage: `os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')`
- Added validation to ensure required environment variables are set
- Added SSL enforcement for database connections

**Before:**
```python
db_password = "sentinel123"  # SECURITY RISK!
```

**After:**
```python
db_password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
if not db_password:
    raise ValueError("DB_PASSWORD environment variable must be set")
```

### 2. API Authentication Added
**File Fixed:** `services/nlp/main.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Added JWT token verification middleware
- Implemented permission-based access control
- Added authentication to all sensitive endpoints:
  - `/analyze` - requires `nlp:analyze` permission
  - `/analyze/sentiment` - requires `nlp:sentiment` permission
  - `/analyze/behavior` - requires `nlp:behavior` permission
  - `/models` - requires `admin:models` permission
  - `/models/{version}/load` - requires `admin:models` permission

**Security Features Added:**
- JWT token expiration checking
- Role-based permissions system
- Secure token validation with proper error handling
- Officer ID tracking for audit trails

### 3. Docker Security Hardening
**File Fixed:** `docker-compose.yml`

**Changes Made:**
- **Database Security:**
  - Removed external port exposure (5432, 9200, 9300)
  - Added `no-new-privileges:true` security option
  - Enabled read-only filesystem where possible
  - Added non-root user execution (`user: "999:999"`)
  - Made volume mounts read-only where appropriate

- **Elasticsearch Security:**
  - Enabled X-Pack security (`xpack.security.enabled=true`)
  - Added TLS encryption for HTTP communications
  - Removed default passwords, require environment variables
  - Added certificate management for SSL

- **Environment Variables:**
  - Removed all default passwords from docker-compose.yml
  - Required all sensitive values from environment variables
  - Added secure Elasticsearch authentication

### 4. Environment Configuration Security
**File Created:** `.env.template`

**Security Features:**
- Template for secure environment configuration
- Clear documentation of required vs optional variables
- Security best practices documented
- Instructions for generating secure JWT secrets
- Warnings about password rotation and strength requirements

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with configurable expiration
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with granular permissions
- **Officer ID tracking** for all API requests
- **Token validation** with proper error handling

### Data Protection
- **Environment variable usage** for all sensitive configuration
- **SSL/TLS encryption** for database and Elasticsearch connections
- **Secure key management** with proper file permissions
- **Read-only filesystem** where possible in containers

### Network Security
- **Internal-only database access** (no external port exposure)
- **Service-to-service communication** within Docker network
- **TLS encryption** for Elasticsearch communications
- **Secure container networking** with isolated networks

### Container Security
- **Non-root user execution** for database containers
- **No-new-privileges** security option enabled
- **Read-only filesystems** where applicable
- **Minimal attack surface** with reduced capabilities

## üö® Remaining Security Considerations

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Certificate Management:**
   - Generate proper SSL certificates for Elasticsearch
   - Implement certificate rotation procedures
   - Use proper CA-signed certificates in production

2. **Secret Management:**
   - Use a proper secret management system (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Implement secret rotation procedures
   - Never store secrets in version control

3. **Monitoring & Logging:**
   - Implement comprehensive security logging
   - Set up intrusion detection systems
   - Monitor for suspicious API usage patterns
   - Log all authentication attempts and failures

4. **Network Security:**
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Use VPN or private networks for service communication
   - Consider service mesh for advanced traffic management
   - Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection

5. **Legal Compliance:**
   - Implement proper warrant verification systems
   - Ensure chain of custody for digital evidence
   - Add audit logging for all evidence access
   - Implement data retention and deletion policies

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and set all required values
- [ ] Generate strong, unique passwords for all services
- [ ] Generate secure JWT secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates for Elasticsearch
- [ ] Configure proper firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging systems
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization flows
- [ ] Verify all external ports are properly secured
- [ ] Review and approve all environment variables
- [ ] Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Security Validation:
- [ ] Run security scans on all container images
- [ ] Perform penetration testing on API endpoints
- [ ] Validate JWT token security and expiration
- [ ] Test database connection security
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded credentials remain
- [ ] Check for proper error handling (no information leakage)
- [ ] Validate all authentication and authorization flows
- [ ] Test rate limiting and abuse prevention

## üîç Security Testing Commands

### Test Authentication:
```bash
# Test without token (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"texts": ["test"]}'

# Test with invalid token (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"texts": ["test"]}'
```

### Test Environment Variables:
```bash
# Verify no default passwords are used
docker-compose config | grep -i password
# Should show ${VARIABLE_NAME} not actual passwords
```

### Test Container Security:
```bash
# Check container runs as non-root
docker exec sentinelbert-postgres whoami
# Should return 'postgres' not 'root'

# Check security options
docker inspect sentinelbert-postgres | grep -A5 SecurityOpt
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **These fixes address the most critical vulnerabilities** but security is an ongoing process
2. **Regular security audits** should be performed on the codebase
3. **Keep all dependencies updated** to patch known vulnerabilities
4. **Monitor security advisories** for all used technologies
5. **Implement proper incident response procedures** for security breaches

The security fixes applied here transform the SentinentalBERT project from a fundamentally insecure system to one that follows security best practices and can be safely deployed in production environments with proper operational security measures.
